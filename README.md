CMPE-240 Final Project

## Installing
This project is designed to run on a Raspberry Pi running Raspbian OS with a GUI.

Run `sudo bash prerequisites.sh` to install required programs and libraries.

## Running 
When running on the Raspberry Pi use `sudo bash bluefix.py && sudo python3 replInterface.py`.
Make sure to click on the Bluetooth icon on the taskbar and click "Make discoverable".

On other systems, or if you disable bluetooth, you can just run `python3 replInterface.py`.
